## Introduction

This section introduces the key concepts and methodologies used in our research. We focus on the scaling of ecosystem services to better understand regional impacts and guide policy development.

Using Hugo shortcode for a figure with a caption:

{{< figure src="img/test.jpg" title="Fieldwork during data collection" class="w-50 p-3 float-start" >}}

Alternatively, using raw HTML to embed an image:

<div class="testclass">
  <img src="img/test.jpg" class="w-50 p-3 float-start" alt="Sample Image">
</div>
<img src="images/test.jpg" class="w-50 p-3 float-start" alt="Another Sample Image">

Using Markdown for simpler image insertion:

## Research Objectives

1. **Understand Spatial Variability:** Examine how ecosystem services vary spatially at different scales.
2. **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate the impacts of land use changes on ecosystem services.
3. **Data Integration:** Integrate satellite imagery and field data to model ecosystem services at regional scales.

## Key Findings

Our research has highlighted several critical insights:

- **Spatial Heterogeneity:** Ecosystem services demonstrate significant spatial variability, influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors.
- **Scale of Influence:** The scale at which data is collected significantly affects the interpretation and applicability of the findings.
- **Policy Implications:** Our findings support the need for scale-aware policies that can effectively address regional and local challenges.

### Visualizing Data

Here we present visual data that demonstrate key concepts of scale and their implications:

### Conclusion

This research provides foundational insights into the scaling of ecosystem services, offering a crucial lens through which policymakers can view and assess the landscape-level impacts of environmental decisions.
